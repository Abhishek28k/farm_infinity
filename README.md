# 🌾 Farmfinity - Smart Crop Recommendation System

Farmfinity is an AI-powered web application that predicts the most suitable crop to grow based on soil and environmental conditions such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K) levels, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.

## 🚀 Features

- 🌱 Crop recommendation using machine learning models
- 📊 Trained on real agricultural datasets
- 🧠 Uses both Random Forest and Deep Learning models
- 🖥️ Interactive frontend built with HTML, CSS
- 🔗 Backend powered by Django (Python)
- ☁️ Hosted on a live server (add your hosted link here if any)

## 🧠 ML Models Used

1. **Random Forest Classifier**: For high interpretability and performance.
2. **Deep Learning Model**: Built using TensorFlow/Keras for enhanced accuracy.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Django (Python)
- **ML Libraries**: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, pandas, numpy
- **Deployment**: (Add info like PythonAnywhere, Heroku, etc.)



## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abhishek28k/farm_infinity.git
   cd farmfinity

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

python manage.py runserver
